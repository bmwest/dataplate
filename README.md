* Ruby version: 2.3.3

Reactive Rails application for custom recipe management. Users can build a personal recipe database accessible on the web and via mobile. User authentication utilizes Devise for Rails. Recipes are maintained by ActiveRecord, and the UI for ingredients and instructions was built with React. The application was built using the MVC architectural pattern through Rails. Recipe content can be modified with updates over time to accommodate changes in ingredients, prep-time, and instructions.

I like to prepare meals at the beginning of the week. Many recipe blogs have a strong story-telling component, host ads, and display media content that sometimes hinders the accessibility of recipe content. With a custom recipe database, users can streamline the cooking process with access to ingredients and instructions on a concise platform. Users can input sentimental family recipes, personally crafted dishes, and meals from across the web.
